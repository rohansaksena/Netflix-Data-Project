## Project Setup:
To clone this repository you need to have Python compiler installed on your system alongside pandas and seaborn libraries. I would rather suggest that you download jupyter notebook if you've not already.

To access all of the files I recommend you fork this repo and then clone it locally. Instructions on how to do this can be found here: https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo

The other option is to click the green "clone or download" button and then click "Download ZIP". You then should extract all of the files to the location you want to edit your code.
